## üìñ Project Overview
This repository explores the Famous Paintings Dataset sourced from Kaggle to answer key questions about artists, museums, and artworks. By analyzing this dataset, we gain insights into the art world, such as identifying prolific artists, comparing museum collections, and understanding artistic trends.

# 1. üõ†Ô∏è Defining the Question
We aim to explore the Famous Paintings Dataset to answer the following:

- Which artist has the most paintings in museums worldwide?
- What is the most common painting style exhibited in museums?
- Which artists have paintings displayed in multiple countries?
- Which country houses the highest number of museums?

# 2. üìä Collecting the Data
The dataset used in this project is the Famous Paintings Dataset, sourced from Kaggle. It comprises multiple interconnected tables that provide detailed information about artists, paintings, museums, and related attributes. The key tables are:

### Artist: 
Contains details about artists, including their full names, nationality, artistic style, and lifespan.
- Key columns: artist_id, full_name, nationality, style

### Canvas Size: 
Describes the dimensions of painting canvases and their labels.
- Key columns: size_id, width, height, label

###  Image Link: 
Links to images of paintings, including URLs for small and large thumbnails.
- Key columns: work_id, url, thumbnail_small_url

### Museum: 
Provides data on museums where artworks are displayed, including their location and contact information.
- Key columns: museum_id, name, city, state, country

### Museum Hours: 
Lists the opening and closing times of museums by day.
- Key columns: museum_id, day, open, close

### Product Size: 
Links paintings to their dimensions and price information for sale or regular pricing.
- Key columns: work_id, size_id, sale_price

### Subject: 
Defines subjects associated with paintings, such as themes or categories.
- Key columns: work_id, subject

### Work: 
The main table for artworks, linking paintings to their artist, style, and museum.
- Key columns: work_id, name, artist_id, style, museum_id


# 3. üßπ Cleaning the Data
Data cleaning involved using Excel to remove duplicate entries, ensuring the dataset was free from redundant records. 

# 4.üîç Analyzing the Data
Using SQL queries, we analyzed the dataset to uncover:

### Fetch all the paintings which are not displayed on any museums?
```bash
SELECT * FROM WORK
WHERE museum_id is null;
```

### Are there museuems without any paintings? 
```bash
SELECT m.name 
FROM museum m
LEFT JOIN work w 
ON m.museum_id = w.museum_id
WHERE w.work_id IS NULL;
```
